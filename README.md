1.What is it about? 

    Ad.1 
    I carried this project just to learn the basics of HTML5, CSS3 and JS with jQuery elements. 
	Its my first project, so the initial version of the site (no subpages) took me about 10 days.
	Earlier, I read articles, watched videos and read books about how to create webpages nowadays.

2.What I learned here?
  
    Ad.2 
    Through this project, I learned the following things:
  	
  	2.1. Structure of HTML5 file.
  	2.2. Basics of CSS3 and SASS (nested elements are awesome!).
  	2.3. Jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com/) as a simply Blog CMS based on RUBY. 
         This includes files such as settings.yml, where the addition of new customer 
         data adds new elements to the slider on the page. Likewise the posts. 
         The page displays last 3 posts that are generated in a file giving only the date,
         author, any image and content. On click page redirect to that post subpage based on post layout.
  	2.4. What is RWD - Responsive Web Design (includes design, media queries etc.) .
  	2.5. Basics of Bootstrap (container with responive columns, dropdown-button for mobile view, glyphicons).
  	2.6. Parallax backrounds (moving at scroll or staying in one position).
  	2.7. Basics of JS and jQery:
  	     2.7.1. Adding class .sticky to the navbar which change background to white when user scroll page by 200pxs
  	            and add .scroll-to-top button at 800pxs scroll.
  	     2.7.2. Adding class .active-section to elements of navbar when specific section reach top of the page.
  	            These elements also gets .active-section class when you clik on them.
  	     2.7.3. Smooth scroll through #sections on click.
  	     2.7.4. Simply slider with next and previous arrows which change the displayed customer and their
  	            opinions about the company. It also change .active-dot at bottom of thw slider. 
  	            These dots are also part of navigation through clients.
  	     2.7.5. Loader-gif at start before page loads fully.

3.What next?

    Ad.3 
    Now I will design subpages for clients, post archivum, services etc. Then I will code them:)
    I also want to optimize the page to load faster. I'll check the page for most browsers 
    and make a changes if needed.
